Slimezone is a game I created in a team of 5. The player controls a slime. It has mechanics such as flattening, going through vents, and eating enemies. The game has an eerie atmosphere. Includes music and art assets.

Lightning contains a remake of the retro game Star Castle. I created it with a team of 5. It utilizes assets that resemble the game "Doodle Jump." The mechanics of the game are otherwise the same as Star Castle.

The folders contain Unity Asset files. To run the game, compile the game in the Unity software.
